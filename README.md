# Honey Inventory: sweet command line inventory control that supports scanning barcode labeled items

## About

Honey Inventory began out of a need for a flexible inventory control database for our [honeygear.com](https://www.honeygear.com) products that can 
handle input from barcode scanning UPC codes. Also, we wanted an inventory application which 
can be used on a small laptop at remote locations but still integrate and sync with our 
[bomquote.com](https://www.bomquote.com) webapp, so I built it. Honey Inventory is a command line 
driven app but it is in essence a full fledged backend inventory system which is also able to be easily 
wrapped and integrated into a webapp or desktop application. It requires a relational database 
like postgresql or mysql which is compatible with SQLAlchemy (most of them) and also depends on Redis for caching. 

## Primary Goals
1. allows easy creation of transient or permanent storage locations that can contain multiple skus. This is a solution
 for dealing with a scenerio like:
   - "I just recalled 5000pcs of product from Amazon.com FBA covering 50 SKUs, and of course they shipped 
 them back to me in 200 different mixed sized cartons of jumbled up SKUs, and I need to do an inventory audit."
2. support barcode scanning to be able to quickly deal with a scenerio like:
   - slap a label on the mixed carton Amazon sent you to call it a "inventory location", scan all the UPCs of the carton
    contents to get a count of what's in the carton, throw them back in the carton so you don't have to deal with sorting 
    them while still knowing for certain what's in the cartons. 
3. generalize this to be a core inventory solution backend for a desktop or web application like [bomquote.com](https://www.bomquote.com). 

## NOTE: UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Currently this library is under active development and is not fully abstracted 
for use as a general public library. You can definitely make it work for you 
right now but you'll need to review the source code and probably make changes to 
fit your environment and get it running. Note that the scripts in the `bin` folder 
currently use the `click` command line library because that's what I started out 
before switching over to the Cement Application framework, which is a more robust 
framework for both command line and backend development in general. But, I intend to 
keep up with the click maintenance so you can use it with click if you desire. DB migrations 
are also handled with `click` for convenience in using it as a script configuration in 
my Pycharm IDE. Integrating the alembic migrations into the `honey` application itself is 
planned but lower on my priority list.

Otherwise, I recommend you read up on the excellent 
[Cement documentation](https://docs.builtoncement.com/getting-started/framework-overview),
a few easily overlooked points are below:

- Ensure to set your config in config/honey.yml and some coode logic assumes the 
the filename will be called `honey.yml`

- All configuration settings can be overridden by their associated environment variables. 
For example config['honey']['foo'] is overridable by $HONEY_FOO.

## Quickstart Installation & Configuration

1. git clone or fork this library and clone it to your local repository.

2. ensure you have a top level database created in postgresql or similar which is compatible with SQLAlchemy.

3. navitage to the repo `config` folder.  Find the `honey.yml` and modify the `DB_CONNECTION` string to fit your needs. 
On my dev machine this is `DB_CONNECTION: 'postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:password@localhost:5432/hgdb'`

4. Install requirements, If you are running miniconda, which I'm sure you are because this is 2020, then be sure to 
activate your environment to install the requirements. 
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    
    $ pip install e .
    ```
5. Honey Inventory uses Alembic for database schema migrations. This allows you to create new database tables or modify 
existing tables. To brush up on Alembic see the 
[Alembic Tutorial](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html). 
  To get started, you need to:
    - edit the `sqlalchemy.url` parameter in the alembic.ini file to ensure your database connection string is correct, 
like `sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:password@localhost:5432/hgdb`
    - open a command prompt in your top-level project folder, then init your database migrations by running the `alembic init` command

6. after your database is initialized with the blank tables created, to run the application, navigate to the repo folder:

    ```cmd
    c:\Users\bjord\repos\honey_inventory>
    ```

    Then, run the `honey` command in your command prompt window.  For help, run `honey --help`.

7. populate your database with some initial warehouse, container, and product/SKU data, like your barcode numbers and 
SKU descriptions.  For example, we have about 50 different product SKUs for our [HoneyGear.com](https://www.honeygear.com) products and all those SKUs 
can be stored in various carton sizes, so the 50 SKUs in different carton sizes quickly become a few hundred different 
items to inventory. That top level descriptive data all needs to be initially entered into the database for configuration before you can 
do do work like add specific quantities for your SKUs. So, we need to populate the following five tables with 
configuration data:
    - `warehouses` table
      - enter unique names to designate top level locations for places where goods are stored
      ![Image of warehouse tbl](https://github.com/bomquote/honey_inventory/blob/master/images/warehouses_tbl.png?raw=true)
    - `containers` table
      - list the kind of containers are your goods stored in and reference them to each other to describe parent-child relations. 
      ![Image of containers tbl](https://github.com/bomquote/honey_inventory/blob/master/images/container_tbl.png?raw=true)
    - `entities` table
      - create an entry for each of the ultimate owners of the inventory/products in your database
      ![Image of sku_owners tbl](https://github.com/bomquote/honey_inventory/blob/master/images/sku_owners_tbl.png?raw=true)
    - `sku_attrs` table
      - A table allowing the creation of key:value grouping designations for Skus.
        Like, Sku Family (Grapple, Flux-Field, ...) and Sku Class ('Pro', 'Grip', ...) and Colors ('white', 'black', ...).
        This allows to detail the main features which comprise your product SKU variants, similar to setting up variants 
        on Shopify, Ebay, Amazon, etc.
      ![Image of sku_attrs tbl](https://github.com/bomquote/honey_inventory/blob/master/images/sku_attrs_tbl.png?raw=true)
    - `product_skus` table
      - enter in your detailed sku numbers, upc codes, descriptions, owner_id, and container_id
      ![Image of product_skus tbl](https://github.com/bomquote/honey_inventory/blob/master/images/product_skus_tbl.png?raw=true)

8. Associate your `sku_attributes` table records from the `SkuAttribute` class with the relevant `product_skus` table records from the `ProductSku` class.
    - For example, I need to associate `family: Grapple` to all of our Grapple Grip Skus, which have Sku codes that start with the letter 'A'
   ```python
   from honey.core.database import session
   from honey.models.skus import SkuAttribute, ProductSku
   
   for sku in session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('A%')).all():
        print(sku)
   ```
   returns...
   ```python
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-L', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-L', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-T', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-T', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-M', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-M', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-L-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-L-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-T-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-T-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-M-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-M-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-L-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-L-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-T-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-T-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-B-M-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A1-W-M-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-L', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-L', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-T', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-T', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-M', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-M', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-L-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-L-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-T-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-T-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-M-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-M-BX', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-L-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-L-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-T-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-T-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-B-M-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    <ProductSku ('A2-W-M-IC', <Entity HoneyGear>)>
    ````
   All of these Sku's are "Grapple" family products. Then, in a python console, do similar to this for all the relevant sku attributes which you've defined:
   ```python
   # attributes which I loaded into the sku_attribute table during initial configuraton
   class_grip = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='Grip').first()
   class_pro = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='Pro').first()
   color_white = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='white').first()
   color_black = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='black').first()
   connector_usbc = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='usb-c').first()
   connector_iphone = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='iPhone').first()
   connector_micro = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='micro-usb').first()
   family_flux = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='Flux-Field').first()
   family_gforce = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='G-Force').first()
   family_grapple = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='Grapple').first()
   family_tract = session.query(SkuAttribute).filter_by(value='Tract').first()
   
   # these queries capture our major HoneyGear sku families, which I loaded into the product_skus table during initial configuration
   grapple_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('A%')).all()
   gforce_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('B%')).all()
   ffield_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('C%')).all()
   tract_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('D%')).all()
   
   # skus which need associated with the "Grip" attribute
   grapple_grip_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('A1-%')).all()
   gforce_grip_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('B1-%')).all()
   ffield_grip_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('C1-%')).all()
   
   # skus which need associated with the "Pro" attribute
   grapple_pro_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('A2-%')).all()
   gforce_pro_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('B2-%')).all()
   ffield_pro_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('C2-%')).all()
   
   # white color and black color skus
   white_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('%-W-%')).all()
   black_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('%-B-%')).all()
   
   # find the skus with different cable types
   micro_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('%-M%')).all()
   iphone_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('%-L%')).all()
   usbc_skus = session.query(ProductSku).filter(ProductSku.sku.like('%-T%')).all()
   
   # now, you just have to associate your sku_attributes to your product_skus, here is one example
   for sku in grapple_skus:
       sku.sku_attrs.append(family_grapple)
   session.commit()
   ```
   After this initial sku attribute setup is completed, we can then easily access the attributes for any sku as follows:
   ```python
    a1_w_l = session.query(ProductSku).filter_by(sku='A1-W-L').first()
    a1_w_l.sku_attrs
    [<SkuAttribute class=Grip>, <SkuAttribute family=Grapple>, <SkuAttribute connector=iPhone>, <SkuAttribute color=white>]
    [(attr.key, attr.value) for attr in a1_w_l.sku_attrs ]
    [('class', 'Grip'), ('family', 'Grapple'), ('connector', 'iPhone'), ('color', 'white')]
    ``` 
   todo: make this setup easier by integrating attribute association into the command-line framework
