    A location for a Sku. Right now I think of an InventoryLocation `label` as a
    unique name/number per each warehouse, for a Container which may hold multiple
    different SKUs. For example, we have mixed master carton boxes of retail packaged
    products and this will enable us to just put a label on each top level master
    carton box in a warehouse and call that label the "inventory location". Then,
    inventory locations are identified by the label. We associate the inventory
    location labels with SKUs in the Association object relation table,
    `SkuLocationAssoc`. I'm sure this can be made more complex for some use cases
    but it's already flexible and will cover the need for many use cases.
    Add extra data in the SkuLocationAssoc class (must migrate if changed).

    NOTE for changes: this model is imported in alembic/env.py for migrations.

    An association object for Skus and Locations. The left side of the relationship
    maps a Sku as a one-to-many to InventoryLocations. This allows one SKU to have many
    InventoryLocations, offering significant flexibility when combined with the
    ease of creating transient locations. The association allows to add some extra data
    like sku quantity in the location, and can also capture items like cost
    and sales price here as well. Then, the association class maps a
    many-to-one to the InventoryLocation, so we can have mixed Skus in a single
    InventoryLocation. Finally, we can use association_proxy to work with the
    data in this table, as done in the models/skus.py file in the ProductSku class.
